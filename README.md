Bermuda Weed Optimization: A Scalable Meta-heuristic for Cloud-Based Cruise Control Systems
######
Bermuda Weed Optimization (BWO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the growth and reproduction strategies of Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon). The algorithm mimics two key mechanisms of the plant:

    Sexual reproduction (via seeds): Represents local search, refining solutions near the current best positions.

    Vegetative reproduction (via stolons): Represents global search, exploring new regions in the search space through horizontal spread and node development.

The plant’s adaptability to fertile and poor soils is also modeled, aligning with the algorithm’s ability to intensify search around promising areas while maintaining exploration in suboptimal regions.

This repository contains the MATLAB/Python implementation of BWO, designed for solving continuous optimization problems. The code is structured, commented, and ready for use in benchmarking or applied optimization tasks.
